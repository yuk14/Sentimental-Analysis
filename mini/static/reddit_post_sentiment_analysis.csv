Typical sub-continent behavior in comments. Lost a game & asking for heads has started! India is still a better team than SL. The SL ladies played their heart out & were better today. Indian team as well as their fans should take this defeat in their stride & learn to be better than this. The team should use it as a fuel in T20 WC (just how Aussies did when they lost a group match with us in 2020 WC).,0.6588,2024-07-28 13:09:06,Positive,typical sub-continent behavior in comments. lost a game & asking for heads has started! india is still a better team than sl. the sl ladies played their heart out & were better today. indian team as well as their fans should take this defeat in their stride & learn to be better than this. the team should use it as a fuel in t20 wc (just how aussies did when they lost a group match with us in 2020 wc).

"Congratulations to Sri Lanka! They've been a rising team in last year or so. First with England series and now this. This must do wonders to their self belief. Especially winning without Chamari being the sole show. WC In Bangladesh will be exciting for them.

"Congratulations to Sri Lanka, They played brilliantly. After Chamari got out with some 70 odd needed, I thought Lankans were done. But Harshitha and Kavisha batted brilliantly. Deserving winners.

"What a game. What a finish... Both the the semi-final and Finals involving Sri-Lanka have been classics.

Finally Sri Lanka are Asia Cup Champions. Chamari is a Champion. Harshita didn't let her fielding bloopers affect her batting. Loved the carnival atmosphere at SL's games, the music , the live bands, the dancing, so many young girls, moms, grandmas smiling and cheering in the stands. What a sight to see. Hope this win inspires more fan support for Sri Lankan women's cricket and family support for more girls to take up the game.

Well played India. You were brilliant throughout the tournament. But in sport anyone can have a bad day and today was one of those days. Those calling for Harman's head need to take a chill pill.",0.9483,2024-07-28 22:26:29,Positive,"what a game. what a finish... both the the semi-final and finals involving sri-lanka have been classics.

I've been saying this for months. This Sri Lankan team has a very real chance of knocking out India/Australia in the upcoming T20 WC. The crowd played the perfect 12th man!

"You can take it in stride when it's two equals.

With all due respect to SL, India has had better resources at their disposal. They play a lot more cricket and have a lot more exposure. Nothing less than winning the tournament was acceptable. 

Losing 2 out of 3 editions is serious imo. 

Harmanpreets stats in T20 are poor, her temperament is poorer. 
Her technique is questionable. Sweeps everything in sight. Does she not have any other shot. It's painful to watch. She doesn't even bowl anymore. Does she really warrant a place in this side ? I think no. She's playing on her reputation here. 

 Good reality check though. Agreed.",-0.2192,2024-07-28 13:28:14,Negative,"you can take it in stride when it's two equals.

"I think this loss will gonna be a humble down indian women team, especially in Asia cups.

Will never forgive the Aussies and the Kiwis for letting Harman score those centuries in world cups because that pretty much is why she’s even relevant in Indian cricket these days.

Exactly. We'd been coasting till now and needed to be humbled. I really think the captaincy is due a change. Harmanpreet creates so much pressure on other players when things aren't going right.

"Yes playing on reputation - at least in T20s. You can't be taking 20 balls to settle every time. The game has gone past it. 

I guess this loss should question her leadership. It's 2 losses in 3 editions since she has taken over.

Other players including Smriti won't question her. In that context Diana Edulji was a really strong selector.
