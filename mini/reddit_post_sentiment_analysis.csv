Someone please report her to whatever fang companies she claims to have gotten money/gigs/whatever from. 

BTW that's why I never opensource any of my shit. Github has free private repos. Keep two: one private and one public for contributions (issues/discussions). Or at least separate your core functionality private and opensource just the UX/UI.
