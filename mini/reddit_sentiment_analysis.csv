"If you want a truly great movie about the allied war effort leading up to D-Day, check out ""Ike: Countdown to D-Day."" Tom Selleck is the most expensive thing on screen.",0.5267,2024-07-22 16:13:43
"Whenever somebody gets money for an extremely un-sexy movie concept like this, it's at least worth paying attention. There's nothing obviously, widely compelling about this concept (logistics, weather forecasting, and planning) so either the director is making a personal monetary investment, or they had a *really* good pitch for producers.

EDIT: I'm begging people to read beyond the headline: the movie is about the *lead-up to* D-Day. It'll end before the invasion. The point is that there isn't going to be a big fight scene, or a bunch of special effects, or explosions or anything blockbusters typically depend on to get people's attention.",0.6941,2024-07-22 15:49:08

"I've mentioned this in other reddit posts over the years. Eisenhower was smoking six packs a day and drinking as many as two dozen cups of coffee a day in the run-up to D-Day. You wonder if subconsciously he was trying to give himself a heart attack so the burden would pass to another. (I say that in jest, but the guy would go on to have a history of cardiac episodes.)

My grandfather was a meteorologist on the Pacific front and was asked to give a weather report for Hiroshima on the morning of the bombing.

However, I think this one could actually be his real full comeback. The audience for this movie would be much larger and the character and theme of it should widen it's appeal even more. The role should also be a great opportunity to show people Fraser's acting chops, which is one thing that The Whale already showed.

"Personally I find it incredible compelling. The idea that pulling the trigger is the last step and only possible because of millions of pieces working in harmony and cooperation before it is fascinating. 


Everything from designing the weapon, testing it, building it, training soldiers to use it, shipping it overseas, planning the invasion, coordinating between however many countries, obtaining and processing the natural resources, the education that went into the scientists and engineers who made all that possible, the teachers, mailmen, garbage collectors, mothers, fathers, who raised all the people in every step of the process. It all has to work.

Now, theoretically Eisenhower would have had some degree of authority over MacArthur when he became Chief of Staff of the Army after World War Two, but MacArthur's unique position as SCAP and governor of Japan, as the relative weakness of the Chiefs of Staff at that particular time meant that MacArthur tended to interact primarily with the State Department or the President himself.

"When the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964 (pushed through by LBJ, a Southern Democrat), a much larger proportion of Democrats voted against it than Republicans, as the South was still broadly ruled by segregationist Southern Democrats descended from the same racist plantation Democrats that started the Civil War, and this extended to their legislative caucus. 

In the Senate, the final tally was 73-27, with 46 Democrats and 27 Republicans voting in favor, and 21 Democrats and 6 Republicans voting against (yes, the Dems had ***67*** Senators). 

The parties were not ideological back then. It's not even really accurate to talk of a ""party switch,"" as that places the Democrats as conservatives and Republicans as liberals before roughly the 30s, which isn't accurate either. 

The parties were more just regionalist. If you were from the NE you were a Republican, if you were from the South you were a Democrat, everything else was up for grabs. They could switch their ideological orientation incredibly rapidly if they thought it would be best for winning the election or if the party just felt like it because of a compelling speaker, including shifting dramatically from hardcore conservatism (Grover Cleveland, a Bourbon Democrat who was a laissez-faire economic conservative) immediately to left-leaning agrarian populism (William Jennings Bryan). Even though Bryan was a redistributionist populist, the traditionally conservative South still was rock solid behind him because the Democrats were simply the party of the South at that time. 

Right afterwards the Republicans made the same switch from economic conservatism with McKinley to progressivism with Roosevelt (caveat, McKinley got shot and Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency, but he still won the nomination on his progressive politics), who *also* ran against Bryan in 1904. These kinds of things were completely normal back then, as ideological sorting was just not how American parties conducted themselves.

There are basically only 2 things that have been relatively consistent for both parties in their entire existence: one, the GOP has always been relatively friendly with big business even in their most interventionist and economically left-leaning eras (Teddy Roosevelt, Eisenhower). Even when they were crushing slavery in the Civil War, they were basically waging a bourgeois revolution against the feudal-agrarian Southern aristocracy.

Two, the Democrats have always had a ""populist,"" everyman streak, being founded by Andrew Jackson seeking universal white male suffrage instead of the property restrictions that had been the norm til that point. That ""populism"" has varied dramatically between racists like Jackson who sought equality for all *white* men, at the expense of everyone else, to the left wing populist progressivism of FDR and Bernie Sanders.",0.8402,2024-07-23 01:51:43

"Argos!!!

As they were speaking, a dog that had been lying asleep raised his head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos, whom Odysseus had bred before setting out for Troy, but he had never had any enjoyment from him. In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went hunting wild goats, or deer, or hares, but now that his master was gone he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw Odysseus standing there, he dropped his ears and wagged his tail, but he could not get close up to his master. When Odysseus saw the dog on the other side of the yard, dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus seeing it, and said:

‘Eumaeus, what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap: his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks, or is he only one of those dogs that come begging about a table, and are kept merely for show?’

‘This dog,’ answered Eumaeus, ‘belonged to him who has died in a far country. If he were what he was when Odysseus left for Troy, he would soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But now he has fallen on evil times, for his master is dead and gone, and the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their master’s hand is no longer over them, for Zeus takes half the goodness out of a man when he makes a slave of him.’

So saying he entered the well-built mansion, and made straight for the riotous pretenders in the hall. But Argos passed into the darkness of death, now that he had fulfilled his destiny of faith and seen his master once more after twenty years…
Homer, The Odyssey

Edit: Our feckless lives, lived for nothing but ourselves; But their lives lived for nothing but others. History is full of tales illustrating the loyalty of dogs; their lives spent fulfilling their one hearts desire—to love and be loved. Perhaps if we took a moment and pondered on the virtue of dogs, and lived as they do, we could find faith in our own species again. I am not religious by nature, but there must be a cosmically important reason for our relationship with dogs. They orbit our lives and when that ends, they crash into our hearts. This is as true today as it was 2500 years ago.

Edit 2: Just sharing my favorite epitaph from a Roman dog’s grave:

“I am in tears, while carrying you to your last resting place as much as I rejoiced when bringing you home in my own hands fifteen years ago.”

">but there must be a cosmically important reason for our relationship with dogs.

We co-evolved with them. They domesticated us as much as we domesticated them. Without taming wolves, we don't domesticate any other animal, save possibly cats, since we have no way to protect our herds. Arguably, the reason we out bred homo neanderthalensis was because we were better at making dogs (they may have also domesticated dogs, possibly before we did, but we did it better).

"The View From Halfway Down

The weak breeze whispers nothing
the water screams sublime.
His feet shift, teeter-totter
deep breaths, stand back, it’s time.

Toes untouch the overpass
soon he’s water-bound.
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
the view from halfway down.

A little wind, a summer sun
a river rich and regal.
A flood of fond endorphins
brings a calm that knows no equal.

You’re flying now, you see things
much more clear than from the ground.
It's all okay, or it would be
were you not now halfway down.

Thrash to break from gravity
what now could slow the drop?
All I’d give for toes to touch
the safety back at top.

But this is it, the deed is done
silence drowns the sound.
Before I leaped I should've seen
the view from halfway down.

I really should’ve thought about
the view from halfway down.
I wish I could've known about
the view from halfway down—

I talked him out of it, mainly telling him that this shit wont matter in a year, hell even a weeks time. And after the emotions wore off, he realized he got caught up in the moment and forgot to see the big picture.

Anyway. about 6 years later I was working as a patrolling night guard, checked all kings os communal places and schools.

One night I hears an odd noise from the school playground. On the roof of the school sat a girl, 14-15 years old. Dangling her legs over the schoolyard. I didn't think much of it, it wasn't very high up. But I got up to the roof and was about to say something, so I didn't scare her, when I saw she had a bag of pills. 

I think she was about to pour them into her hand but I can say that for sure, she was holding it in a way that made me think that. 

I didn't scare her, she didn't care at all. We talked for about 2 hours. from 0200 to 0400 or so. She hated her life and her BF had broken up with her and she wanted him to hurt as much as she did. I mostly listened. After that she was feeling better and she went home.

"The problem with this is **you** have to do it. And when you're in this state, that's the one thing you can't do. 

That's why loneliness is really the most dangerous thing facing the world right now. So many people are so close to the line, wavering on a nightly basis, with solutions at their finger tips, but unable to help themselves and no one around to help them. 

They can reach out to a friend, but the guilt of bothering someone stops you so easily. The allure of relying on the state to clean you up, and removing yourself (in your mind, the problem) from the equation instead of burdening others becomes dangerous.

Not trying to judge, but I'd expect a therapist to know it's not as easy as ""go get your scripts, my man"".

The real answer is to spend all your energy finding and maintaining friends. When you're well or unwell. And never isolate yourself.",0.613,2024-07-18 05:01:21

This is key in understanding depression, and many other mental illnesses too. You can be rich, have a loving family, have amazing friends, your life can be free from any external struggle... and you'd still be miserable, or want to kill yourself. Many people have and will continue to, regardless of how good or bad they have it.

There are a lot of people who are depressed due to events in their life, or due to their circumstances. Improving those circumstances would surely go a long way to alleviating their suffering. But that's only ***one*** way someone might experience depression, not the ***only*** way. You can have it despite living a normal life, and even an extremely privileged one.

"I think one of the things that helped me approach it is the concept of Santa Muerte. I'm not religious, but it's a really comforting notion that got me to look at death differently. So the idea is that when your suffering in life becomes too great Santa Muerte comes to free your soul and gently shepherd you to the other side.

Let's say you were to die suddenly in a car accident tomorrow, the outlook would be that the accident was so bad, and your body so broken from it that the suffering involved in recovery (or lack of recovery) would have been too much to bear. So in her kindness, Santa Muerte came to lead you to peace on the other side.

Think about how much more horrifying it would be if people *didn't* die. That people could be permanently trapped in completely broken bodies and the excruciating pain they'd be stuck enduring. That'd be hell on earth. 

I don't actually believe there's a literal Santa Muerte. Nor do I believe there is an ""other side"". But for some reason it still gives me comfort, the idea that death only comes when our suffering becomes too great. That suffering can come on suddenly and unexpectedly (car accident) completely blindsiding us, or it can come slowly and surely (the effects of aging), but it eventually gets too much for all of us. But to suffer is a condition of being alive, not dead. Death is simply the end of all suffering.",-0.9957,2024-07-18 09:25:43
"I work for a nonprofit and someone at one of our events was trying to sell drugs, was told to leave, then emailed us afterwards saying he was suicidal and that was his last hope. It was a really emotional email and I don’t think he was putting it on to “get us back” for kicking him out. 

In the email he said the line, “it’s so hard to keep asking and asking and asking for help and not find it. I can’t keep asking, I’m done.” And I know exactly how he feels when everywhere you reach people just tell you platitudes and refer you somewhere else. 

I asked the rest of the team if we could brainstorm something that is a step beyond emailing back with “resources” (ie “here’s the suicide hotline”) like they wanted to. Could we show him that as part of the “community building” we tout in our mission statement, we can try to make a little extra effort to show him that *someone truly cares* for this man at the end of his rope? I didn’t have a concrete plan but was just suggesting the idea of thinking outside the box. 

Was 100% shut down because “we can’t be responsible for him.” It was pretty triggering and disappointing. 

I wasn’t suggesting we actually provide the services or resources, but that we find a professional that can guide him to getting help.

They learn to co-exist with the Deetz family, especially the daughter, Lydia after some hiccups with a bio-exterminator named Beetlejuice along the way.

Then there was the cartoon that forgot about the Maitlands where Lydia and wild party ghost with the most, Beetlejuice, go on zany adventures in the above and netherworld.

40 years after the film, we pick up with stepmom, Lydia and bio-exterminator Beetlejuice come back along with Lydia's daughter to do what?

There are a lot more locations in this. The first almost entirely takes place in the house. The Monica Bellucci character is absolutely an original element. 

There were a lot of very original sets &, let's say, ghost-world gags. For example, >!Lighting a chalk drawing of a bomb on the walk that explodes like a real bomb!< or >!spilling his guts!<.

I suppose one might consider the >!Bob characters!< a reference but I see them more as an expansion from the first movie.

Also, Tim Burton has practically destroyed the style he created using bad CGI. And it was bad because of his decisions, not because of the hard work people put in.

That isn't discrediting the work or effort of VFX artists who will inevitably do lots of clean up and VFX for the finished product, but more about how the mentality of using VFX during production should be. Giving the actors (and everyone else) tangible/physical props and sets to act on/with can drastically improve morale and acting. 

Maybe a similar point to Ian McKellen and Lord of the Rings vs The Hobbit. Lord of the Rings used a lot of practical effects on set, especially to get the size difference for Gandalf vs the Hobbits, whereas The Hobbit relied on green screens, which really affected his morale.",0.7996,2024-07-18 16:30:23

I'd say always. Certainly at this level. Same with the ""names on poster in a different order than the people on the poster.""

One of the more funny examples I've seen is for, of all movies, Under Fire (1983). Gene Hackman is on the poster in an inset diamond as a head shot. The artist that made the poster got all the way to the final print before Gene Hackman's People got a look and determined that Gene's headshot was too small. He had a contract stipulation that when appearing on a poster, he had to be as big as everyone else. So Drew Struzan (artist) re-did just that part of the poster and pasted it over the smaller original part, and he didn't have to do it all over.

"Thats what was told to the public, but we have no idea if Netflix actually made this a requirement or not. It's a vanity project either way for sure. My personal theory was that Netflix set the budget at different amounts based on the rating, which is something regular movie studios do as PG-13 is more marketable so you can risk a higher budget. He then uses these funds to make the PG-13 and R rated cut as we know from promotional images that there will be more scenes with full CGI in this version, presumably there will also be new action scenes and so on (which i guess were too violent for the PG-13 version? That or he's purposefully undermining one cut for the benefit of the other) 

now on paper this seems like Netflix wouldn't be okay with him saying he's making it PG 13 only to put the real effort into the R rated cut but I assume they already knew about this scheme ahead of time and even if they didn't it really still benefits them as from a business standpoint it's almost like getting two movies for the price of one or 4 for the price 2 since part 2 will certainly get a directo's cut as well.

Nobody really cares about the story of Warcraft 1, they really care about Warcraft 3, but you still have to set up a shitload of lore to get 3 working. 

Essentially I think the concept played straight is unfilmable as a movie or would have to be broken up into multiple entries.  If not a TV show, you would probably have to make a movie for each of the WC3 campaigns (or at least several movies with all concurrent events) and then use flash backs or exposition dumps of some sort to fill in the historical gaps. A LOTR/Lynch Dune style opening recap of WC1 and 2 might work as well.

The other core issue with WC1 is that they yada yada the actual story of WC1, choosing to basically just have them talk about the game's events in a war room instead of showing them. We barely see any actual war in Warcraft.",-0.9228,2024-07-21 17:36:49

"The nepo baby discourse is really not ready for people to reckon with the fact that the majority of the pop culture people they stan are from well off if not very wealthy backgrounds because that's how a lot of the real world works (ever look into a politician or company head's background? Really the vast majority of well off people come from well off backgrounds), but are still perturbed by that knowledge so instead obsess over people with famous parents because it's easier to process it and compartmentalise it while also letting others off the hook.

Like, of course having a famous actor parent will help you as you start off your career as an actor, you grew up in the trade (no different than entering the same profession as your parents or inheriting the family business), but having a wealthy or famous parent in one field won't help you get started in another. Apart from the advantages of a wealthy upbringing (which are great) the 'nepo baby' has to have aptitude to excel in that profession. Like, Robert Oppenheimer couldn't ring up A24 and tell them to let his grandson make a movie and get anywhere. 

I often think that all the right wing grifters who failed to break into Hollywood underline how nepo baby stuff is super oversimplified and misunderstood - I mean, Ben Shapiro comes from a wealthy background, is cousins with Mara Wilson, tries to make it as a screenwriter, doesn't, then goes on about 'woke evil Hollywood' the rest of his life. Honestly think examples like his should underline that him having lawyer parents or whatever didn't guarantee him a career in the arts. Maya Hawke and Ben Platt clearly had an advantage to the start of their careers others wouldn't, but they actually had the talent. But also, Hulk Hogan's kids got further in wrestling than any of the acting or singing they pushed for because their dad's connections went further in some places than others regardless of their talent, graft, and aptitude.",0.9688,2024-07-22 18:14:33

This would align with the film's other messages better than the released ending. And would also explain those scenes of the kitchen staff which were otherwise really disjointed and unrelated to the rest of the movie.",-0.6962,2024-07-16 18:56:49

"> The whole idea behind the movie is pretty much locking two characters in with each other and seeing how they'll react with certain situational modifiers.

The whole idea is ""the platform"", which is a symbolism for resource redistribution. They explore this idea in a few different (an not fully coherent) ways. They use the device of getting 2 characters together, but the whole idea of the movie is that ""platform"" and the social commentary that should go with it.

If they are making a sequel, it can be in a couple of different directions: a) exact same premise, different characters, different dynamics, different outcome, b) variation on the premise (ie: the resource distribution scheme is changed, it can be by changing the way people move up and down in the social ladder), with the same or other characters.

"I think it's the fact that the message was simply lost in translation, as opposed to depicting something more along the lines of *""we know, we just don't care,""* implies the people above are canonically well-meaning and just don't understand. Even though the characters knowingly perpetuate this extremely unjust and vicious system, they're still considered *""innocent""* by the film.

The metaphor IMO breaks down at the idea that they just don't have an effective enough message to get them to see the issue. Rather than the movie advocating for more radical and fundamental change to the ENTIRE system, they just tell the audience that it's the prisoners' fault for not being able to get through to them - It gives the (wrong) impression that the system itself isn't bad, and that it's JUST the fact that those above are mistaken in how much to gift those below.

"I don't think it lacks sense. For ANYTHING to come back up on the platform, it has to make it down to the incredibly deep levels, where all is depraved and hellish. If a weak, innocent, defenseless little girl was to descend with the platform to those levels, the natural assumption would be ""She's going to be killed and eaten,"" because the people down there are completely mindless savages who have been driven insane by hunger.

For her to come back up, it means she was able to bypass every one of those levels, which sends the message that the people down there have retained their dignity despite the horror they're being forced to endure. It sends a defiant message to the people up top that they refuse to fully lose themselves to the barbarism of the system, that it hasn't broken them.",-0.9666,2024-07-17 13:39:29
"Didn’t they send the panna cotta up as a sign that all levels could cooperate and only eat what they needed, thinking maybe the whole Platform idea was a test. The head chef interprets the returned food as a sign that they (the kitchen) failed,  as it had a hair on it, maybe not even realizing how much violence and suffer was going on below them. I think they thought they were making food for “special guests”, like super-high people?

The whole movie is a metaphor about society: people at the top (the higher platform levels) take more than what they need, leaving the people below them to suffer and fight over the scraps, especially at the lower levels. The people at the very top (the head chef/chefs) are totally oblivious (whether intentionally or just due to their privilege) about how rough it is for most people (the ones actually in the platform).

"""What day is it? The date! WHAT YEAR?!""

I convinced my friend to watch both The Terminator and T2 for the first time in her life a few years back. With no nostalgia factoring in, she said The Terminator was the superior film—the grittiness, the action, ths 80s gritty dark downtown LA energy, and even one of the greatest love stories ever. 

The theme song even has a sense of hopelessness to it in this one. For me, Kyle's future flashback of the 2 kids watching the TV set revealing to be a fire for warmth hits hard.

Even though I personally go by the head canon that the story ends at T2, I'm surprised none of the sequels ever thought to make Arnold an evil Terminator again. Arnold was the scariest bad Terminator. That first kill to the wrong Sarah Connor is cold blooded and he later takes out an entire police station.",-0.4486,2024-07-20 19:42:46

Dark Fate was made exactly how Cameron wanted it. He's one of those people who always has to be in control.  

I understand that Cameron is going to reboot the franchise. It won't have Arnold in it.  

I don't have any faith in Cameron making a reboot that I'd like. Personally, I think the very first film was the best. It was dark, gritty and felt like the humans had no hope whatsoever against a relentless hunter, an unstoppable machine that would eventually find them no matter where they hid or what they did.

"I much prefer T1 as well.  

It's darker, more gritty. It feels more personal, a more immediate danger with it being just two humans against an almost unstoppable, relentless hunter that feels nothing.  

If you think about it, the Terminator is in effect like an undead creature, like a mummy. I think that's what makes it work so well. It can tap into that fear of the undead, bringing it in to a science fiction setting.  

I think that shifting the focus to making it more of a machine versus machine fight in all the sequels spoiled the effect. I think they tried to counter that by trying to make us feel empathy towards the machine protecting John, making it seem more human. But it's just not the same.  

It seemed to me that they kept trying to recreate T2, but with bigger special effects and more powerful Terminators as if that must make the films better.  

I honestly have no idea if the general public, or the fans, would have been OK with something different, or if they kept doing basically the same thing over and over as that's what they thought would sell well.  

What if they did some films focused on Skynet trying to kill members of John's future team? That could have lead into them meeting John and then into the future war.  

Or what if a Terminator is sent back to protect a human from being killed, only for that person to find out that the Terminator protecting them is sent by Skynet. That person is instrumental in Skynet being created.  

That opens up a whole ethical dilemma. Would the human assassin sent by the resistance from the future convince them to not do their research, etc. which is instrumental in Skynet's creation, or would they have to kill them?  

Or would that person kill themselves once they learn about how their work will help Skynet wipe out most of humanity?  

Or would they join the resistance? Maybe they would play an important part in reprogramming captured Terminators. If so then they'd have to defeat the Terminator which was trying to protect them to ensure Skynet's creation.",0.9434,2024-07-20 20:35:51

"It's complex, but the material of the film available that year made for an extremely grainy image that displeased Cameron back then.


The ""terribleness"" of Aliens 4k is not the same as other upscale with ton of DNR making the image look like crap. In Aliens case it's been done very well and there's still a bit of grain left.


Also, the color grading was fucked for the DvD transfer so what most people remember being the ""true colors"" are actually bad color grading on the DvD.

The issue boil down to color grading being now closer to the theatre release and VHS that people aren't used to anymore and the grain.

Also, Cameron removed the grain to get the looks he wanted to have at launch but couldn't due to technical reasons and people being used to it.

In that alternate timeline he rescued Sarah when she was a little girl from being killed by another Terminator and acted like her father, plus he aged, hence being called Pops. I don't think it was revealed who sent the Pop/Guardian Terminator back in time.  

Carl was the Terminator who killed young John at the beginning of Dark Fate. He's the one with the decorating business. That was put in by Cameron as he knew Arnold liked decorating. The bait and switch, saying that Furlong was in Dark Fate, was Cameron's idea too. Linda Hamilton knew the fans would hate it. Dark Fate may have been directed by Miller, but it was really a Cameron film.

"> The originals hit hard, the new ones are bland.

The original sounds are stock gun sounds from the 60s and 70s that are used in many low budget movies and TV shows of that era. They have little dynamic range and don't match the weapons they are fired from.

For the plasma weapons, shortened, manipulated gun sounds were used. It worked ok on the majority of cinema speakers, for drive-ins and for home viewing on VHS.

However, if you want to make a modern 5.1 mix with good frequency range, those sounds aren't good material.

> And what the hell did they do to the infiltrator-units gun??

The new sound is more like what the RBS-80 would sound like, and it is my favorite of the future gun sounds, because it's realistic. However it is a discrepancy with other uses of the same gun, probably to make it the same as the sounds used in T2.

Generally the future weapon sounds aren't consistent between movies or even inside each movie in neither the old or new mix.",-0.3726,2024-07-20 19:23:20
"I think that's a good approach to film restauration to avoid screwing up an old film, but there's nothing to artistically connect those gun sounds to this film.

I really doubt James Cameron had cheap stock sounds in mind, when he made the film. Had there been more money available, they would have recorded custom sounds for those exact guns, where they were needed, but that was expensive in those days.

That means also, if the gun sounds had been properly recorded, nobody would have complained about that, just that the movie sound work now was in line with the rest of the movie. This conversation wouldn't exist and people would have praised the movie just as much as they do now.

The gun sounds in the film are not at all accurate to the guns that fire, which is strange to see in a movie that focuses pretty hard on realism.",-0.9176,2024-07-21 10:23:46

There were other movies of that era that sounded more original and sophisticated. Some were more stylized, but still original.

The fact of the matter is that the original mix only exists, because they couldn't afford a better one, and the movie would not have sounded like that, if they could.

I'm certainly arguing from a technical point of view, because the gunplay in The Terminator has always been praised for its realism, so why should the guns not also sound realistic?

And that was mostly thanks to Leigh Brackett's first draft setting all the groundwork for that movie before she died of cancer.

Irvin Kershner directing *also* really helped. Lucas is a *great* big picture storyteller, but an *awful* writer when it comes to condensing the big picture into its smaller details. And an awful director for demanding certain line readings/deliveries out of his actors, leading to some of the most painfully awkward moments of the prequels.

The main problem with Lucas is that he simply got rusty. Even with his shadow-directing, he probably only directed a single digit number of films. Half of his official filmography is the Prequel trilogy, which came something twenty years after his filmmaking prime. Between that, the switch to digital in AOTC and ROTS, and the simple march of time in filmmaking technique, Lucas was left behind and the Prequels reflected a stale form of directing.

His writing, though, was always somewhat suspect. The Prequels enabled the worst of his writing impulses since he was the one who penned those scripts, but there was always a little jank in anything he wrote, and it was down to the director and the editors to see how much of that jank could be toned down and/or removed.",-0.5794,2024-07-21 07:16:31

I just think about how easy it is to pinpoint each decade through basic aesthetics, music, and social struggles. After you leave the 2000s, things get really redundant and conglomeratized to the point where the most reliable way to define the 2010s until now is purely technological convenience and consumption.

I think we all revert back to using technology as the main signifier of advancement, but it's really hard to separate the changes in QoL in the US when so much of the daily grind is exactly the same for the past 2-3 decades; oftentimes worse.

"I got connected to the internet in 1992 at university, it was still 6-8 years before it was widely adopted. I got the www set up in 1995, so the first 3 years of that were basically using usenet and email. 

So just the internet. And imagine having that in a phone. Shit the computer I got upon graduating to do basic graphic design and gaming stuff probably had less power than my Galaxy 1 smartphone in 2010 did. RAM was still in megabytes and a 2.5GB hard drive seemed huge. I think people would be really excited to see it, but at the same time shocked at how dominant it has become in life - folks that are just tethered non stop to screens and who play their music without headphones too.

I think people who were extremely progressive on race relations and LGBTQ issues in the 1990s would be considered racists and homo/transphobes in modern times if they maintained the same views. 

""Rock music is dead"" - I don't really agree with this, but 1994 was one of the great years for rock music and I think someone who timewarped to 2024 might be shocked what radio was like.

Also just how hyper partisan we are, I had a bit of a freakout with the contract with America/Gingrich revolution in 94, but I don't think anyone then would be prepared for what we see today.

Fashion has certainly changed - I don't view 94 as peak 90s fashion and we've kind of moved outside of the period that was a stark backlash to 90s fashion, but I think folks are generally better put together and clothing is better cut/less boxy even when it has been turning towards looser fits lately. 

The million to billion joke probably is now billions to trillions.

And lets not forget that Austin Powers was pretty much an extreme caricature of that Beatles meets the mods look, so we wouldn't even be comparing every day 90s people, but it would be someone steeped into one of the 90s subcultures too.",0.7995,2024-07-17 18:36:17

">Where is the culture clash?

Someone obliquely pointed it like this: in the 1990s people wanted Forrest Gump to be an uplifting story about an inspirationally disabled man who manages to be present at major moments in American history and ultimately have a fulfilling, financially rewarded life, but people in the 2020s would want Forrest Gump to be savvy, sophisticated man who attends major moments in American history and is ground down by the system. 2020s Forrest Gump, according to this person (though I came up with these specific touchpoints myself), would probably inspire the Republicans to discover the Lewinsky affair, would end up serving in Iraq, would get injured, become hooked on opiates, have his marriage to Jenny fail after they lose the house in the GFC, convince Comey to reveal the FBI had reopened the Clinton investigation and so on... and then he probably ODs on fentanyl at the end, leaving Jenny with the kid instead of vice versa. Also, we must have a medical debt bankruptcy at some point...

I'm not actually sure they were wrong. I hope they are, but I'm not sure.

The tech would be bewildering. The 90s are the time of calling the internet the information superhighway. We have tech billionaires that want to put computer chips in human brains.

Rap music is way more mainstream.

Attitudes about what not being racist looks like are totally different. 

Sexual mores have changed a lot.

Gen X no longer exists. That is, Gen X people exist but they're either Boomer of Millennial coded. The notion of a Generation X is no longer remotely relevant.

Fashion has changed. I imagine 90s Austin would exaggerate the difference through having extremely 90s taste.

Expectations of the spy genre changed completely at the end of the decade. There's no meaningful difference between Pierce Brosnan's version of Bond and Roger Moore's, but Daniel Craig's Bond would be the villainous henchman, if he could appear at all, in their films.

I would assume that the 90s Austin is a big believer in ""the end of history"", only to discover that the talking points of the 2020s have more in common with the 1920s than the 1990s. This is not unrelated to the Forrest Gump comparison.

Subcultures are dead. As someone said somewhere on Reddit the other day ""When everything's a subculture, nothing is"". Their point was that subcultures need a clear idea of what they're not, but there is no longer a monoculture to serve as the outgroup.",-0.8766,2024-07-18 01:27:55

"Having sat down and watched all of the James Bond movies a few years ago and then following up with Austin Powers, something that I think is important about how Austin Powers spoofed Bond is it actually does so in a really roundabout way.  Commander Bond complains about the Beatles in one of the movies, and generally stays far away from the Liberal side of the culture of the time.

Austin Powers, meanwhile, has Austin be a hippy.  He is utterly the opposite of Bond, in basically every way that matters (while being completely like him when it comes to being killed by the villain).

I think in order to really do an ""updated"" spoof movie like that, you would again have to take some kind of movie from the 90s that is ""quintessential"" to that time period, and make the spoof character the counterculture to that.  Like spoof Con-Air, but have the character be part of grundge culture or something like that (I was a kid in the 90s, so am having a hard time coming up with a romanticized version of the 90s that people nowadays hold that is distinct from the 90s I remember, but hopefully you get my meaning).",0.8417,2024-07-17 20:49:46

*Austin is enjoying a New Year/Millennium Party full of young people in wacky 90’s clothes. He is dancing with a Beyonce look-alike because we can’t afford her cameo rates.*


*Basil Exposition enters looking frantic. He carries a duffle bag.*


Basil: “Austin! AUSTIN!”


Austin: “Yes? What is it Basil?”


Basil: “Something terrible has happened! Dr Evil has become a legitimate business man and thus they’ve slashed our budget, and I’m afraid there’s more bad news.”


Austin: “Bogus! What’s happened? Have we been sacked?” (Austin now uses outdated nineties slang, instead of sixties slang)


Basil: *Begins assembling a fire extinguisher-like device from components in his bag* 


“No Austin, our computer algorithms believe you’ll be needed again in the future. The bad news is that we have to freeze you once again!”


Austin: “Not again! The nineties are so radically tubular dude!”


Basil: “Well think of how groovy and tubular the future will be!”


Austin: “You’re right, Basil! Why, with President Gore here to save us from Global Warming and the expansion of the Information Superhighway bringing us all together; 


*Basil looks worried, but finishes his device*


Austin continues: “Why, in just a few decades we’ll be living in an unprecedented era of global peace and prosperity! Very, Radical Dude.”


Basil: “Austin.  The Supreme Court forced Florida to stop counting ballots and declared George W Bush to be President-Elect.”


Austin: “Saywhatnow?”


Basil: “No matter. I’m sure Tony Blair will give Global Warming his all. Well, my Quantum Freeze Gun is assembled. This device will freeze your mind, quantumly, while your body ages at a normal rate. It’s much better.”


Austin: “Wait, so I’ll age by decades but I won’t feel it? Why don’t I just time travel? How is this better that freezing my body in ice?”


Basil: “It’s cheaper.”

*To camera* 

“MUCH cheaper than de-aging CGI Deepfakes”


Austin: “What?”


*Basil zaps him. Freezing him in carbonite.*

I can wear clothes from nearly 15 years ago and not be that out of place. Vs 95 to 85 or 85 to 75 and do on. Clothing being a visual representation of the concept that was universally experienced. 

People often blame 9/11 for the change in America, and it was really a big part of it, but we really started to change into what we are today during the lead up to the invasion of Iraq and the '04 election. That's when you really see the partisan stuff really going full swing in the culture. The reporting on the 06 mid terms were nuts compared to what had come before.

"94 is _just_ far enough in the past that you could do an interesting version of that story.  I think it would be a much more tragic kind of comedy.  But yeah for whatever reason culture doesn't feel like it has moved as fast in the last 30 years as it did leading into the 90's.  Some stuff has changed wildly, but the 90's still feels like ""the start of the present"" rather than ""the end of the past.""

In 1994, it's immediately after the end of the Cold War.  1992 was the start of the new post-Soviet era, and there was a lot of cautious optimism.  Personal computers were common, but far from universal in the US.  They were still being treated as borderline mythical in TV and films.  Lawnmower Man came out in 1992 and the plot was basically that clunky early 90's CGI could turn an idiot into a cyber god evil genius malevolent entity.  Almost nobody had email or an Internet connection, but the Internet was definitely something you had heard of.  Most PC's still ran DOS and only ran one program at a time, and frequently crashed and needed to be rebooted.  Some businesses still ran with no computer, not even something to do a spreadsheet or a word processor.  1994 was the last season of Star Trek The Next Generation, i.e. the end of the ""strictly optimistic"" era of Star Trek's vision of the future.

So you have a spy who is coming from this very optimistic moment of change, and what has turned out to be an incredibly naive idea of what the future would be.  He thinks he's getting frozen just before the Internet connects everybody and solves the world's remaining problems.  He thinks he's getting frozen at the End of History.  We knew about global warming with plenty of time to prevent the worst outcomes, and fusion power is only 30 years away if we invest in the R&D...

He wakes up and everything he was optimistic about has gotten worse.  The Soviets are gone.  But the guys who were there ares till assholes.  History kept happening and most of the time he was frozen was covered by a war in Afghanistan, longer than any modern war was before ""peace.""  Computers are universal and have gotten a million times cheaper and faster and bigger, and we use them for shitposting and propaganda and TikTokkers melting attention spans and Russian bots encouraging people to do stupid shit.  But the frozen spy can no longer _do_ anything about it.  His mastery of smuggling microfilm, and quickly shuffling through paper documents, doesn't address any of the problems or serve any purpose in an era of email and Google Docs.  Imagine Austin Powers but just fucking sad and useless.  And every time he lobs a great quippy one-liner, whoever he is talking to doesn't notice because they are doomscrolling.

The optimism is what you would build the culture clash from the 90's on.",-0.9939,2024-07-17 21:35:59

They brought up a lot of stuff that I simply wasn't aware of because I was a kid. They thought things were best when they were kids, but they had the self-awareness to understand that it maybe just seemed better because they were kids.

In the 90s, people were terrified of sexual predators and kidnappers because that was the only thing on the news. The catholic church was still successfully covering up child abuse, and there was a ton of rot in society hidden beneath a conformist beige exterior. Adults felt that society was filled with evil men waiting to kidnap and kill their children, and young people felt like their individualism was being crushed by pressure to conform.

There's a reason that movies like Office Space, Fight Club and The Matrix resonated so strongly with people in the 90s. Conformity was king in the 90s, and breaking away from society was a dream that many people dreamed of. Blowing up credit card companies to send the world into chaos was a fantasy that people cheered for.

"> The changes in tech and society between the 60s and 90s were much crazier than the 90s to the 20s. To be honest I barely see any major changes to tech/society from 90s to 20s. Outside of smartphones, things have stayed relatively the same or have even stagnated/regressed.

Seriously? The whole technological landscape is pretty wildly different between now and the 90s. Electric cars, smart phones, camera phones, internet access, touch screens, self checkout, Amazon, wireless anything, flat screens, Google maps, Google in general, drones, online dating, livestreaming, the death of physical media, the death of print media.... private companies are doing space flights for rich people! 

The difference between 1964 to 1994 was black and white antenna TV to color cable TV with a VCR. 

The difference between 1994 to now is color cable TV with a VCR to smartphone livestreaming.

I might agree that fashion, hygiene, or language *might* not have advanced as much or as noticeably, but tech?

- The internet/social media really amplifies these extremist voices, making them seem like a bigger part of society than the ‘90s, when in fact they’re smaller, just more noticeable.  
  
I remember a flashback plot line in BoJack Horseman (a modern show that analyzed the ‘90s *really* well) where the writer/showrunner of a popular sitcom was forced out for being gay.

"It’s so hard to judge shows of the past. It’s not that you want to just say “oh it was of its time” in one sweeping claim. But you also don’t want to write off every show/movie that used that term.

At the time, it was seen as a piece of media that explored the difficulties of the gay and lesbian culture because it did address things that weren’t being talked about at the time. Did it handle it with a lot of grace? Probably not. I know that movie would have been condemned had it been made today but at the time it pretty lauded.

Same for shows like entourage. A lot of the slurs were just used at the time. The biggest failing was how Lloyd was written as a character. He was every stereotype.

Yet, Ari loved him. Even said it as much at the end of the show despite how much of an asshole he was. He still appreciated Lloyd. It’s absolutely a flawed show in that respect, but I don’t think it was malicious because they gave Lloyd a lot of power in the end.",0.9584,2024-07-17 19:30:50

"It's not like that's been a steady unceasing trend of acceptance, though. Homosexuality became more acceptable during the counter culture movement of the 60s and 70s alongside the civil rights movement, second wave feminism, anti-war protests, etc. But there was a bigger pushback to homosexuality in the 80s with the Reagan revolution and the rise of the Christian right. Tv shows with gay or lesbian representation had to tiptoe around things or else risk angering the evangelical morality police like Falwell's Moral Majority who would put pressure tv studios. 

Like, you mention ""Love Sidney"" as having a gay lead, which is technically true because it was a continuation of a TV movie that featured a openly gay character. But in the tv show he's not openly gay, they just hint and wink about him being gay without ever actually saying it. The gay characters and storylines from Barney Miller were under constant threat of censorship and were only included because Danny Arnold fought tooth and nail to keep them.

You saw more gay and lesbian characters around the end of the 80s, but well into the 2000s they were mostly just the butt of the joke. Even in the ""groundbreaking"" works of representation the fact that the gay characters were gay was the punchline more often than not. And they were still controversial. The gay kiss from Melrose Place was censored and cut out of the episode. An episode of The Next Generation had it's script thrown out for having a gay couple. The show Ellen started having ""advisory"" warnings at the start of each episode after Ellen DeGeneres came out. 

And that's all just talking about the first two letters of LGBT. Transgender, asexual, and nonbinary representation was decades behind that.",-0.5891,2024-07-17 23:03:09

And it was hugely controversial when that happened, with conservatives calling for boycotts of Disney. The show got cancelled the next year.",-0.7461,2024-07-17 23:33:01
